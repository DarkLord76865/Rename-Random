# Rename-Random
Randomly renames files in same folder


### **!!!CAUTION!!!**

It will rename all files (not folders) in the folder from where it is run. This action cannot be undone so use with great caution. Needs Administrator access because some locations might need it. Runs quietly after starting, files will just appear renamed at once, no other visual sign of it running will be visible (if they don't, try right-click refresh). Useful for randomizing the order of, for example, image files (if you don't care about file names) as image displaying programs will list images alphabetically.
